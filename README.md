# **Project Proposal**

## *The Big Idea*
### Prior to beginning this project, I consulted with family members and friends to identify a real-life problem that needed solving. Although their responses were varied, most mentioned the app 'WhatsApp', which is widely used for communication in Latin America. I discovered that people often struggle to use WhatsApp appropriately in formal settings. The idea that came up was to create a WhatsApp Bot that can convert text messages into voice messages, and vice versa. This concept is particularly useful in situations where it is more efficient or appropriate to express thoughts or ideas verbally, or when it is not possible to listen to a message but reading it would work better. For example, in important gatherings or meetings. 

## *Learning Objectives*
### Regarding my objectives, I'm looking forward to growing my knowledge of utilizing AI to solve real-world issues, particularly in our daily lives. I aspire to gain hands-on experience in implementing AI solutions within the messaging platform WhatsApp. This involves exploring AI algorithms, techniques, and tools relevant to voice message conversion. I see this project as an opportunity to utilize the knowledge I've acquired in Python throughout this semester. 

## *Implementation Plan*
### During our class on session 20, we learned about utilizing OpenAI's API via HTTPS requests. Exploring the capabilities of this API, I discovered a feature titled 'Generates audio from inputted text' available at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech . Additionally, I came across an option called 'Represents a transcription response returned by the model, based on the provided input' at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text. This could potentially help me in implementing the speech-to-text functionality. Furthermore, I looked into resources on Google to learn how to send messages using Python, to start looking at how I could automate messages in WhatsApp using Python. Several articles provided guidance on this, such as: https://medium.com/@sudhanshunamdev45/how-to-send-a-whatsapp-message-using-python-step-by-step-guide-5ce11efe3f2#:~:text=Sending%20a%20Scheduled%20WhatsApp%20Message,to%20include%20the%20country%20code. 

## *Project Schedule*
+ Week #1 (April 1st):  Define the project idea based on initial feedback. Conduct thorough research on libraries, frameworks, and resources essential for project execution. Finalize and submit the project proposal, outlining the main objectives, MVP, and stretch goals.  

+ Week #2 (April 8th): Begin implementing OpenAI's API for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities. Familiarize myself with the API documentation and start coding the WhatsApp Bot.  

+ Week #3 (April 15th): Start the development of the project website. Design the visual elements and layout, ensuring that is an easy to understand interface. Test the integration of OpenAI's API with the WhatsApp Bot features. Also, Debug any issues encountered during testing. 

+ Week #4 (April 22nd , due date 27th): Review all code to identify areas for improvement. Conduct testing to ensure all features function as intended. I will seek feedback from peers and professor to gather insights for further improvement. 

## *Risks and Limitations*
### I believe that the most significant threat for this project’s success is the accuracy and reliability of natural language processing (NLP) models employed for text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion. These are critical for delivering accurate results: Inaccuracies, misinterpretations, or limitations in NLP algorithms would not make the WhatsApp Bot work.  

## *Additional Course Content*
### For my project, topics such as Flask and HTML are very important, particularly for the development of the project's website. Flask provides the framework necessary for building web applications, while HTML serves as the language for structuring the web page and presenting the content in an easy-to-understand way. Also, API integration skills are crucial, as I aspire to incorporate OpenAI’s API into the WhatsApp Bot. Another important topic is debugging techniques, these are essential for identifying and resolving potential issues within the project's code. Effective debugging helps to improve the operation of the WhatsApp Bot, minimizing disruptions and optimizing performance throughout its development.
